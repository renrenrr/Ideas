# Introduction

This is where I keep projects that are inspired by my everyday life. Generally, the projects are developed for convenience and to suit my requirements.

## H2S House Info

Renting a house is difficult in the Netherlands. At that time, I mainly focused on h2s' directly-booked houses. 

My requirement is to automatically check any available house on the website, so that I could immediately sign in and book it. (**It is not allowed to book the house via an automatic programming!**) In order to be well-notified, I use a telegram bot to send me a message which includes the expected information (e.g. rent fee).

Since the h2s website is well-organised, the data related to the available houses can be directly pulled out by a web scraper. Here, I use Beautiful Soup.

The project is not automatic yet, but I have no need to continue it.

## Text Scraper

I have a preferred app to read novels, which only supports .txt file. Also, I hate reading directly on the website, as it takes time to load the page. Therefore, I built this text scraper to extract the novels from some specific websites into a .txt file. 

The text scraper differs when applied to different websites, based on the contents I observed via the inspection tool.

**This project is only used to fit my reading habit, I still pay for the novels.**
